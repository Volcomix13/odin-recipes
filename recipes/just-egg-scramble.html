        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz JUST Egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 garlic Cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2/3 cup bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Over medium heat, in a non-stick pan add oil or vegan butter. Add chopped onions and saute for 1-2 minutes. 
                Then, add minced garlic, mushrooms, and peppers. Saute for 5-7 minutes, or until softened.</li>
            <li>Shake the bottle of JUST Egg. Pour the JUST Egg into the pan with the cooked vegetables. Let the mixture sit
                 for a moment, then using a spatula stir the mixture to prevent the JUST Egg from sticking to the pan. 
                 Season with salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the JUST Egg for about 5-7 minutes, occasionally using the spatula to push the cooked center to the 
                outer edges and moving any uncooked mixture to the center to cook. Cook the scramble until all of the liquid 
                has been cooked through and resembles scrambled eggs.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chives, green onions, red crushed peppers. Serve over toast or as a side to your favorite breakfast
                 meal!</li>
        </ol>
